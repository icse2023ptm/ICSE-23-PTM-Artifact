> How to install, build, and run our software and download our data

## Download Data

To download all of our data used in our paper (including the HFTorrent dataset), you will need to use `git lfs` to clone our repository.

Please execute:

`git lfs clone https://github.com/icse2023ptm/ICSE-23-PTM-Artifact`

The HFTorrent dataset is divided into 19 parts of ~20 GB each.
Please use an extractor capable of extracting `7z` archives to unpack the dataset.

## Build From Source

The Python code in this repository can be ran as individual scripts, or bundled into a package to be installed on your local machine.

We utlized the `poetry` build tool to create Python packages of our code.

Install `poetry` with:

`pip install poetry`

Then execute (within the top level of the source code):

`poetry build` 

From there, you can utilize `pip` to install a `.whl` or `.tar.gz` Python package from the newly created `dist` directory.
